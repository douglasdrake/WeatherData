# WeatherData

# Project Description
Examine how meteorological variables vary with latitude with plots using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  We would expect the results to be 
specific to the particular date for which the data were retrieved.

# Methods
1.  Generate 1500 random (latitude, longitude) pairs.
2.  For each (latitidue, longitude) pair, find the closest city using the Python module `citipy`.  Only keep the
unique cities found.
3.  Perform API calls to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) with each of the cities to get the current
weather conditions.  The results are returned in JSON format; we convert these to a list of Python `dict` structures during the API calls and then convert this list to a Pandas `DataFrame`.
4.  Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, plot the various meteorlogical variables vs. latitude.  A wrapper function is provided which plots the data, labels the axes, titles the plot with the date, and saves the plot in one function call.

# Results
The code and results are contained in Jupyter notebooks with a name structure `weather-MM-DD-YYYY.ipynb`, where `MM-DD-YYYY` is the date the data were retrieved.
